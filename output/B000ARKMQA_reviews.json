I wore New Balance for years ,their size always fit me , until all of a sudden it didn't. My foot size didn't change. It's taken me awhile to find another good shoe for a reasonable price. Im  70 lb overweight and this makes a difference in the pressure that my feet are under when walking. To my eye it looked like it would be too short but it's perfect.  if you're exactly the size it will fit, but I caution you if your foot is a little longer than a true size. They are not tight on the side. Feels sturdy and flexible. I was able to wear them the first day -  all day , and my feet feel great. Was delivered, quickly packaged well."

I actually enjoyed it, but my feet were killing me. I purchased these sneakers and the arch support is great and I can Doordash all day if I want to and my feet don\u2019t hurt when I go home. So, for me, they are great shoes and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a shoe with good arch support."

I spend most of the day on my feet and they are the only brand of shoe I've worn that didn't leave my feet sore at the end of the day. What I like about this style (only seems to be available through Amazon, not through Sketchers) is that the tongue doesn't slide way off to the side like other Sketchers I've had. This is my third pair, and each has lasted close to a year. My only complaint is that they do not have padding, such as memory foam, and do not have arch support, so they're a tad hard. But again, my feet are not sore at the end of the day so I still keep buying them."

This is a very sturdy shoe, high quality, fits well, though I will replace the insole with a memory foam insole, and please note, the description was clear, did not imply memory foam insert.  I need a bit more arch support, but not complaining.  I'm satisfied and pleased with my purchase and the seller. I've decided to use these for working outdoors during wet/muddy stretches.

She has to stand all day and has back issues from which the sturdiness of these shoes help her through a long workday without her back starting to hurt. NOT FOR YOU IF (CONS): You want memory foam insoles (these do NOT have those) Want arch support Wish to remove the insole for any reason You prefer more softness for your insoles.....these are stiff You like little padding overall in your shoes FOR YOU IF (PROS): You work somewhere that requires you to stand/walk all day (or if you have back/leg problems...or swollen feet) You seek a sturdy and super supportive shoe Want something lightweight but good quality so it lasts a while You dislike having to break in new shoes....these are comfortable straight from the box You have little to no arch in your feet ( NO arch support in these hardly at all ) You love a pair of shoes with some nice soft padding throughout You love toe space in your shoes If you wish to buy insoles for these, it might get a little tight with all the padding already in the shoe, but still an option. Overall, I believe these to be the best for when you are on your feet all day or are going on vacation and need a good pair of tourist shoes. I love that these give my mom what she needs.....it's nice her being able to work pain free and feeling comfortable.....plus they're nice looking shoes....so she can be cute too :) Extremely happy with this purchase as always."

I absolutely DESTROY every sneaker i get my hands on because I'll find one and use it daily- back then it was highschool, now it's work, and in either case i do a lot of running and walking on my offtime. I also have a toewalking habit which tends to make me blow through the average shoe in under a year. Now my last pair were white, and due to work dresscode i needed black shoes. I tried an expensive pair of gravity defyers. 110 or so bucks. And when I say they WRECKED MY FEET. AGONY. Change jobs and i alternate between the two, even after i finally busted the sides of my sketchers. That's how much better these are. That i'd rather wear them broken than a perfectly good pair of gravity defyers that put my down 110 bucks. I finally replaced them and this time in black, and that's probably what I'll do for the foreseeable future. These things last, and they're the pair that keeps me on my feet at my janitorial job where I have to cross a whole outdoor mall multiple times per day. THESE ARE THE ONES."

    "message": "These are great shoes!  Just one problem.  My feet hurt when I wear them.  I believe the problem is with my feet, not the shoe.  I have had problems with my feet my entire life.  When I was a little girl, I had to have my shoes specially made, from as far back as I could remember until I became an adult and started buying my own shoes. Wide short feet, high instep, and flat feet.  I buy shoes all the time and they usually don't fit correctly and cause horrible pain when I wear them.  I end up having cramps in my feet, or calves, many times I wake up with my toes being drawn down from muscle spasms when I am in bed.  So imagine trying to hop out of bed to walk the cramps out when I can barely get out of bed because of the pain in my feet. In many years I have found one pair of shoes that worked and I wore them out.  Then I recently found out that they have been discontinued.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it! My advice to anyone especially buying shoes online, know your feet, know your size, width, if you have a high arch, low arch, or flat feet, high or low instep and any other little quirks your feet might have.  Do you over-pronate?  Be knowledgeable before you buy. I accessed these as \"Fit as expected\".  I have short fat \"Flintstone toes\" and almost every shoe I buy my toes feel cramped and uncomfortable.  These shoes have plenty of room for my toes and that is amazing to me, however when I wear these shoes, the balls of my feet hurt which makes my toes cramp. I will do what I always do.  I will find another pair of shoes to try and give these away. These are good shoes and wear well and are well made.  Just know your feet!"

I took one star off because the photos on Amazon's site are misleading.  One of the other reasons I ordered these shoes was because I wanted shoes that I didn't have to tie.  The photos make it appear as though these shoes do not need to be tied, but they actually do.  I will keep them, but I am a bit irritated that they don't match their picture.  The first question in the Q and A part of the site asks whether they have to be tied, but I did not read that far as the shoes looked so good.  It simply didn't occur to me that the pictures would be so misleading.  Obviously I am not the first customer to notice this."

    "message": "I've been wearing Skechers for years now. When one pair wears out, I get another. I love that I can get plain black sneakers instead of the ridiculous, garish designs most others have. I want something that matches everything. For me, sneakers need to be comfortable and practical. I wear them all day long and flashy fashions that might look \"nice\" but cause pain don't make any sense to me. These Skechers are really very nice looking though! Not only that, they are super comfortable. My feet get sore really easily (I mean, really, like if I get up in the morning and walk around for 5 minutes in stockinged feet, they start to hurt), but I can wear these all day long. I do use gel inserts to add some cushion, though. I've never gotten a blister in a Skecher. They have a wide base so I usually feel pretty surefooted, even on rocky paths in the woods. The nubuck finish is very nice looking, too. There is one thing, though. Generally, I don't even have to break these in. I put new insoles in them, put them on, and I'm good to go. However, something about the tongue or around the tongue over the instep of usually just one of the shoes will push into my foot for a couple of days. It can be really uncomfortable, but after a few days, I guess they get a bit less stiff or something and then it never bothers me again. I do spend those couple of days trying to get that part of the shoe to get a bit more flexible, though. And it seems to work. So, if you are on your feet and you want to be comfortable, have your sneakers match everything and look great without being garish, then get these Skechers. Not only that, they are quite reasonably priced. You totally will get your money's worth out of them, and then some."

I've been wearing them for at least 15 years now and I've loved. Every. Single. Pair. I see lots of negative reviews each with different negative experiences with the shoes so not everyone is a fan. My on-the-job experience with each pair I've owned has made me a satisfied customer. They're durable, comfortable and true to size so there's never a concern that they're not going to fit. Before I started wearing Skechers, I would NEVER buy shoes online because more often than not, they wouldn't fit right or I'd need to return them for other reasons.

In the past 7 years I have had 9 surgeries and left with a bad back, left foot has severe drop foot and right foot has a huge bunion. Yes, that was one surgery but it was done incorrectly. So as you can imagine it is very difficult to find the right sneakers with good support at a price I can afford as I am now on disability. I have been wearing these over a month. Did need to purchase arch supports but I need to on all my footwear. These sneakers are comfortable, wide enough for my bunion and can tie tight enough for my drop foot.  Practicularly a miracle considering all my issues and they alleviate some of my chronic back pain. I ordered my normal size in wide. Perfect fit. The quality of these sneakers is outstanding tho a little heavy but certainly not a problem. I have two dogs I have to walk several times a day and these sneakers make those walks much easier and less painful. I highly recommend them to anyone but especially if you suffer from any conditions like mine"

I knew I would be doing a lot of walking and I wanted a comfortable shoe.  This one was perfect!  I knew it from the first moment I slipped my foot into it.  The soles are thick and provide a lot of cushioning.  I was very comfortable walking on any surface including rocky pathways.  I was also able to walk and stand for most of the day with these shoes with total comfort.  I was so thrilled to find these shoes that I bought a pair exactly like it for my daughter.  My third pair was for myself to keep at a second home where my husband and I do a lot of hiking.  I just purchased my fourth pair.  My original pair is still in great shape except for the tongue has started to look a little worn.  The soles of my original pair are still great and so is the rest of the shoe except for the tongue.  I had fears that I would not be able to find this particular style for much longer so my fourth pair is in reserve if and when my original pair ever wears out.  I expect to walk in total comfort now for many years to come."

    "message": "I love the Skecher Sport women's tennis shoe (this is NOT the one with memory foam cushion) and I buy a new pair every year because it has been the best fitting shoe for me with the most arch support I have been able to find for my feet. I am 5'3\", 115 lbs and very active. I don't have excessively high arches and I have good posture and walk pretty squarely on my feet. I get the most support from shoes with a higher arch and leather durability to keep it there. I didn't give 5 stars this time only because this last pair of Skecher Sports split in several random spots only after a month of wear. The picture is several months later, so the splits haven't gotten excessively worse. But they have impacted the longevity of the shoes."

The first shoe and the work ones.have become a little tight I'm assuming because as my feet lose more arch (extremely flat feet) I need a half size bigger.  This latest pair I did order a half size larger than normal and the fit is great.  Love this style of Skechers.  Good construction and sturdy leather shoe.  The older pair from 2 plus years ago are still in great shape and the work ones are holding up well with the long hours of walking around."

I purchased 3 other sketchers $150 and asics $70 and these so far seem goid. I walked on hard surfaces for 8 hours to give them a test run and my feet were not achy. Unfortunately most of the sketchers just don't seem to have really great support in them like they used to they just seem like any other basic sneaker"

    "message": "I started wearing Skechers Premium sneakers for more than 15 years.  I usually got 2 years out of a pair before they became yard and garden shoes.  I took a break from them the last few years, but decided I needed to go back to what I know fits and is comfortable.  For me they are true to size in length and width.  The arch support is not very aggressive; more in the  moderate range which is perfect for my feet.  Being leather they will stretch a bit and conform to your foot.  I'll likely keep buying these as long as Skechers makes them. My only complaint is that Skechers used to give you 2 pairs of laces -- one white and one blue to match the eyelets.  Now it's just the white.  So, I bought Delele 45 inch long oval shoe laces here on Amazon.  They come in a bunch of colors and the navy matched these shoes perfectly so I can trade out lace colors when the mood strikes me."

    "message": "I'm adding to my initial review...I've worn these shoes for about a year now and I love them. I added some gel inserts because I wear these at the hospital as a nursing student sometimes for 8-10 hours. Some days I am actually standing for 10 hours, only sitting down for a short lunch. I was limited in shoes because my nursing school requires white ones with no visible logos. These shoes are very comfortable, and they've eliminated most of my foot pain. I tend to have tendon pain in the middle or heel of my feet, and I have a bone spur on the heel of one foot. Also, I've put these shoes in the washing machine a few times and they clean up great. Initial review... I needed white shoes with little to no visible logo for nursing school. These had high reviews, so I thought I'd try them. I haven't worn them for a full day yet, but I think they'll be great when I do so. I almost ordered a 9.5 but decided to go up to a 10. I'm glad I did, the 9.5 would not have fit. The 10 fits perfectly. I don't think this is because the shoes run small, I just think I haven't accepted the fact that my feet have increased in size over the years. The true test for these shoes will come in a few months when I'm on my feet for 10 to 12 hours at a time, but I give them 5 stars for my initial impression."

Then the side of the one shoe ripped open. That has never happened before. I think this is my 5th pair and never had a problem before. I no longer have the box or the info to send them back. So I gave it another try. So far so good. I bought the solid white ones. Not that the color matters, but the blue ones were the ones I had trouble with. I was able to rig them up and still wear them. If I have trouble this time I will send them back."

There isn't a lot of arch support which is fine for me (low arch) but I can see how that wouldn't work for others. I have gone through three pairs of these over several years. I love how I can order them online and know exactly what to expect. I have seen several reviews about how the shoes bust at the seams. I have had that happen, but after significant wear. I suspect that the seams are weaker than the rest of the shoe (obviously), but constant strain like laces tied super tight or a lot of side to side motion will weaken the seams sooner. With that said, I would not recommend for aerobics or cross training."

My sister and her husband wear nothing but Skechers and convinced me to try them.This sneaker is amazing!  True to fit, the material is perfect for support yet  very comfortable.  I am so very pleased that even walking is now part of my daily routine once more.  THANK YOU SKECHERS!!!"

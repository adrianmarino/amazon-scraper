  "description": "The Center II is the kind of hard-to-find comfort sneaker that flatters everyone. The rounded toes and sleek structure make feet look slim and dainty, while soft uppers and cushiony footbeds provide an already broken-in feel right out of the box. It\u2019s the kind of shoe that energizes you to get moving and supports you when you decide to go the extra mile.",

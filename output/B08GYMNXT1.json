  "description": "Reebok is an American-inspired global brand with a deep fitness heritage and a clear mission: To be the best fitness brand in the world. Not an easy one. But if there is one brand that can make it happen, it is Reebok, the brand that was fundamentally part of a fitness movement that forever changed the way we look at spandex and headbands. Sure, this is not the 1980s anymore \u2013 the world has moved on. But so has Reebok and it continues to be daring. Daring is knowing greatness doesn\u2019t come from sameness. The past years have been characterized by a transformation from traditional sports to fitness. The three sides of the Reebok Delta, a symbol of change and transformation, represent the physical, mental and social changes that occur when individuals embrace the challenge of bettering themselves in the gym, in their lives and in the world.",
